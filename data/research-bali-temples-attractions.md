# PART 7: GENERAL TIPS & PRACTICAL INFO

---

## Dress Code for Temples
- ALL Balinese Hindu temples require a sarong and sash (selendang)
- Most major temples provide free or cheap rental (IDR 10,000-20,000)
- Bringing your own shows respect and is more comfortable
- Women on their menstrual period are traditionally not allowed to enter temples (this is still enforced at some temples)
- Shoulders and knees must be covered

## Best Time to Visit Bali
- **Dry Season (Apr-Oct):** Best overall weather. Peak tourist season is Jul-Aug.
- **Wet Season (Nov-Mar):** Lower prices, fewer tourists. Rain usually comes in short, heavy afternoon showers -- mornings are often clear.
- **Nyepi (Balinese New Year):** The entire island shuts down for 24 hours -- no flights, no traffic, no electricity, no beach. An incredible experience if you plan for it, but you'll be confined to your hotel.

## Currency & Payment
- Most temple and attraction fees are CASH ONLY (IDR)
- ATMs are widely available in tourist areas but rare in rural/remote areas
- Major hotels and restaurants accept credit cards; small warungs and markets are cash-only
- Carry small denominations (IDR 10,000 and 20,000 notes) for parking and small fees

## Bali Tourist Tax
- IDR 150,000 per person, mandatory for all international visitors
- Paid online before or upon arrival
- Separate from individual attraction entry fees
