### A1. Candi Singosari (Singhasari Temple / チャンディ・シンゴサリ)

**Full Name:** Candi Singhasari / Singosari Temple (シンゴサリ寺院)

**What it is & Why it's worth visiting:**
A 13th-century syncretic Hindu-Buddhist temple, the funerary temple of King Kertanagara (ruled 1268-1292), the last king of the Singhasari dynasty. This temple is remarkable because it was never completed -- visible in the unfinished kala head over the lower entrance and the simple, frameless decorations. The site is believed to be the center of the ancient Singhasari royal court. It is one of the most historically important temples in East Java, representing the end of one of Java's most powerful kingdoms.

**Historical/Cultural Significance:**
The Singhasari Kingdom (1222-1292) was a major Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingdom that preceded the Majapahit Empire. King Kertanagara, the last Singhasari ruler, was murdered by the rebel Jayakatwang in 1292, leading to the kingdom's fall. His son-in-law Raden Wijaya then founded Majapahit. The temple is mentioned in the 14th-century Javanese poem Nagarakretagama (cantos 37:7 and 38:3) and in the Gajah Mada inscription (dated 1351), which was discovered in the temple's yard. The lower level is dedicated to Shiva (Hindu), while the upper cella held a Buddhist dedication -- reflecting the Javanese syncretism of the era.

**What you'll actually see there:**
- The main temple structure: an andesite stone building, square-shaped with sides of approximately 5.20 meters and current height of 14.10 meters. The temple body is empty (no main room inside).
- The **unfinished kala head** above the entrance -- evidence the temple was never completed before the kingdom fell.
- A pair of **colossal Dvarapala statues** (gate guardians) standing 3.7 meters (12 feet) tall -- among the largest monolith guardian statues in all of Indonesia. They wield clubs and are decorated with snakes and skulls, with ferocious scowling expressions. Located about 200m west of the temple, they originally guarded the Singhasari royal cemeteries.

### A2. Candi Kidal (Kidal Temple / チャンディ・キダル)

**Full Name:** Candi Kidal / Kidal Temple (キダル寺院)

**What it is & Why it's worth visiting:**
A Hindu temple erected in 1248 AD to honor Anusapati, the second king of the Singhasari Kingdom who ruled for 20 years (1227-1248). It is one of the best-preserved temples in the Malang area and features stunning Garudeya relief carvings that carry moral messages about liberation from slavery. The temple is a superb example of East Javanese architecture with its tall base and slightly backward-leaning body. Originally 17 meters tall (now 12 meters), it stands elegantly in a well-maintained garden setting.

**Historical/Cultural Significance:**
Anusapati was the son of Ken Arok (founder of Singhasari) and Ken Dedes. He assassinated his stepfather to avenge his biological father, then ruled for two decades before being murdered himself. The temple's Garudeya reliefs tell the Hindu mythological story of Garuda's quest to free his mother Winata from slavery -- a moral allegory about devotion and liberation. This relief is believed to have directly inspired the design of the Garuda Pancasila, Indonesia's national emblem.

**What you'll actually see there:**
- A three-level Hindu temple composed on a raised platform, with a **cubic three-tiered roof** structure.
- **Garudeya reliefs** on three sides of the temple base (south, east, and north):
  - South panel: Garuda lifting three serpents, representing the bondage of Garuda and his mother

  - Read in counter-clockwise direction starting from the south
- **Lion statues** on all four base corners
- Intricate carvings from Hindu epics including scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata

### A3. Candi Jago (Jajaghu Temple / チャンディ・ジャゴ)

**Full Name:** Candi Jago / Jago Temple / Jajaghu (ジャゴ寺院 / ジャジャフ寺院)

**What it is & Why it's worth visiting:**
A 13th-century Hindu-Buddhist syncretic temple built between 1268-1280 CE, constructed to honor Sri Jaya Wisnuwardhana, the 4th King of Singhasari, who is commemorated here in the form of Avalokitesvara (the Bodhisattva of Compassion). The temple is renowned for its extensive and artistically significant bas-reliefs, which are among the finest narrative carvings in all of East Java. The name "Jajaghu" means "majestic" in Old Javanese.

**Historical/Cultural Significance:**
King Wisnuwardhana ruled the Singhasari Kingdom and after his death in 1268, he was deified here both as Shiva (Hindu) and as Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (Buddhist) -- a perfect example of Javanese religious syncretism. The temple is mentioned in the Nagarakretagama (14th century), which describes it as one of the temples visited by the Majapahit King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. The Tantri Kamandaka reliefs here represent one of Indonesia's oldest surviving narrative literary artworks.

**What you'll actually see there:**
- A large rectangular temple base measuring 23 x 14 meters, built on a raised platform reached by stone steps
- **Extensive bas-reliefs** depicting multiple Hindu-Buddhist narratives:
  - **Kunjarakarna** (Buddhist Jataka tale)
  - **Parthayajna** (Hindu epic episode)
  - **Arjunavivaha / Arjuna Wiwaha** (the wedding of Arjuna)
  - **Krishnayana / Kresnayana** (stories of Krishna)

### A4. Candi Badut (Badut Temple / チャンディ・バドゥッ)

**Full Name:** Candi Badut / Badut Temple (バドゥッ寺院) -- The Oldest Temple in East Java

**What it is & Why it's worth visiting:**
Built in 760 CE (Saka 682), Candi Badut is the oldest temple in all of East Java. It predates the Singhasari temples by nearly 500 years, belonging instead to the obscure Kanjuruhan Kingdom. The date of its construction (November 28, 760 CE) is now used as the official "birth date" of Malang city. For anyone interested in the earliest Hindu civilization in East Java, this is the foundational site.

**Historical/Cultural Significance:**
According to the Prasasti Dinoyo (Dinoyo inscription, now housed in the National Museum in Jakarta), this temple was built during the reign of King Gajayana of the Kanjuruhan Kingdom, with Dinoyo as its capital. The temple was "lost" for centuries, buried under soil and vegetation, until it was rediscovered in 1921 by Maureen Brecher, a Dutch controller working in Malang. It was restored in 1925-1926 under the supervision of B. De Haan from the Archaeological Service of the Dutch East Indies. The architectural style is closer to Central Javanese temples (like those in Yogyakarta) than to later East Javanese temples, making it a unique anomaly in the region.

**What you'll actually see there:**
- The temple arranged in three parts:
  - **Foot/Base:** A distinctive 2-meter tall rectangular plain pedestal without any seams or decoration -- uniquely simple
  - **Body:** Portal leading to a main room with surrounding walls

- Andesite stone construction typical of Hindu temples
- The surrounding area where the ancient Kanjuruhan capital once stood
- A peaceful, less-visited site tucked away from main roads

**Entrance Fee:**
- Free admission

**Opening Hours:**

- By public transport: Take angkot/microlet route AT (Arjosari-Tidar), get off at the corner of Jalan Himalaya, then walk north approximately 300 meters

- Address: Jl. Candi 5D, Karangwidoro, Dau, Malang Regency

**How long to spend:** 20-40 minutes

**Visitor Tips:**

### A5. Candi Sumberawan (Sumberawan Stupa / チャンディ・スンブラワン)

**Full Name:** Candi Sumberawan / Sumberawan Stupa (スンブラワン仏塔)

**What it is & Why it's worth visiting:**
The only stupa-shaped Buddhist monument in East Java -- unique among the many Hindu-style candis in the region. Set in a protected forest at 650 meters elevation at the foot of Mount Arjuno, the stupa is surrounded by pine and bamboo trees, creating an atmosphere of sacred silence. A natural spring (sumber = spring, awan = cloud/holy) feeds a pool at the base, and local Javanese still collect the water for rituals and blessings.

**Historical/Cultural Significance:**
Built during the Singhasari period (13th century), contemporary with Candi Singosari. Its Buddhist form is notable because most temples in this area are Hindu or syncretic. The stupa design resembles a miniature version of Borobudur's bell-shaped stupas. The sacred spring at its base has been venerated for centuries and gives the site its name.

**What you'll actually see there:**
- A bell-shaped stupa on a square base, made of andesite stone
